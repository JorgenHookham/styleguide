# Show Whitespace Characters
Like anything done arbitrarily or without thinking about it, trailing whitespace on lines is bad. Turn on your editor's draw whitespace setting so that you can catch those questionable characters trailing in after the other characters in the line have done all of the work.

This is also a good way to make sure indentation is done right, because it will be right in your face *all of the time* if it isn't.
